# spreadsheet_filler_v2.1
Hey! 

This program uses the Google Sheets API to fetch the spreadseet and fill in the values. Since it utilizes the Sheets API,
you are required to have your OWN Google Developer API key and import the "client-secret" file into the directory that this 
program is located in -- otherwise, things will break and it won't work. 

Spreadsheet filler -- this program takes strings from a text file, strips them of the newline characters using translate() and updates the cells in the spreadsheet. A file of sample addresses has been included because I'm such a nice guy. 

Created for Marc Friedenberg's Special Election Campaign in March 2019.
